Machine Learning Library

This is a practice of manually implementing the Machine Learning Algorithms without having to use frameworks such as Scikit Learn or TensorFlow.

Implementations include:

<b>Supervised Machine Learning:</b>

	<b>Regression:</b>
	  - Linear Regression in One Variable
	  - Multi Variant Linear Regression
	  - Polynomial Regression

	<b>Classification:</b>
	  - Logistic Regression
	
	<b>Neural Networks:</b>
	  - Basic 2 Layer Neural Networks with Sigmoid Activation functions only
