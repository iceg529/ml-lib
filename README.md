This is a practice of manually implementing the Machine Learning Algorithms without having to use frameworks such as Scikit Learn or TensorFlow.

Implementations include:

<b>Supervised Machine Learning:</b>

  - Linear Regression in One Variable
  - Multi Variant Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
